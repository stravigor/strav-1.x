 *     payloads (cached blocks, images in a later slice).
 *
 *   - `ChatOptions` — per-call knobs: model selection (explicit `model`
 *     or `tier` sugar), `system` prompt with optional cache flag,
 *     `maxTokens`, `thinking`, `effort`, etc.
 *
 *   - `ChatResult` — what comes back from `chat()`: assistant `text`,
 *     `usage` (including cache hit/miss counters), `stopReason`, the
 *     `model` that actually answered, and a `raw` escape hatch with the
 *     provider's native response.
 *
 * The streaming side adds `StreamEvent` — a discriminated union of the
 * events a provider emits while a response is being generated. V1
 * covers text deltas, the final-message event, and `stopReason`;
 * thinking blocks / tool-use streams land when those features ship.
